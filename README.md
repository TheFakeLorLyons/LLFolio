# Portfolio
A collection of my previous academic, professional, and personal work.

This repository contains the code that lays out my present-day coding autobiography.

It isn't too long yet because I am still relatively early on in my journey; but I am very
excited about the progress that I have already made as a programmer and I am excited to
learn more and improve every day. This website is visible at https://www.lorelailyons.me.
In this codebase, I removed configuration files and assets that are contained in the full
codebase. For anyone interested, you can reach out via my site's contact section, and I
would be happy to talk about any of my work now or moving forward.

The site is primarily focused on my career and education with regard to my programming; but
of course my background is a particularly wide ranging one as a double major in two separate
fields.

It is my belief that philosophy serves as a strong foundation for programming, and I am
very grateful to have studied it. I am also grateful to be studying computer science at this
time in history, even if the market is bad. This is a particularly exciting time in history
because of the developement of many converging technologies. Being adept at combining different
tools for different jobs is increasingly necessary for everyone, and it is also necessary that
we help to make those tools themselves user friendly and accessible. I am very interested in
being involved in creating these tools.

I have a passion for how we interface with technology from the hardware all the way to software,
and I find immense joy in all parts of the software developement process. I have found myself
enthusiastic and inspired every time I sit down to do something even tangentially related to
Clojure or programming as a whole, and I am always dissapointed to be dragged away from a problem
that I am working on.

I am eager to join any team in developing cutting edge and user friendly applications and systems.
If you or someone you know has need of another programmer on their team, whatever the size or environment,
reach out and lets talk about how I can be a part of whatever you might be building.

The technologies I used to make this site include:

Clojurescript and reagent (thus including Hiccup: HTML/CSS/JS), Shadow-cljs, GIMP (for image editing), 
Da Vinci Studio (for video editing), Nginx for the server and Porkbun as a domain service, smartGit,
and all the other small peripheral programs and scripts that help me get stuff done (especially Pureref!)
